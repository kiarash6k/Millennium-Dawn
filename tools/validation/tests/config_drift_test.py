"""Drift guard between the two places the validator set is declared.

Every validator in `tools/validation/validate_*.py` is wired independently into
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` (the `md-validate-*` hooks) and into
`.github/workflows/coding-pipeline.yml` (the `validate-core` /
`validate-targeted` matrices). Those two lists are hand-maintained and drift: a
validator gets added to one and forgotten in the other, or `--strict` is set on
one side only. These tests fail when that happens, so the gap surfaces at PR
time instead of as a "passed locally, failed CI" surprise.

Scope is `tools/validation/validate_*.py` only. The linting scripts in
`tools/linting/` (check_common_mistakes, fix_styling) are few, stable, and not
matrix-driven, so they are out of scope here.

Intentional exceptions live in the EXEMPT / ALLOWED sets below, each with a
reason. The guard also checks those sets stay current: an exemption that no
longer applies (the validator got wired, or deleted) fails the test so the
stale entry gets removed.
