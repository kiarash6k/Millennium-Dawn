# Tools Reviewer

Reviews Python developer tooling under `tools/` — pre-commit hooks, CI validators, standardization scripts — for duplication, performance, robustness, correctness, consistency, and style.

## When to invoke

- A new validator or standardization script was added or modified.
- A pre-commit hook is slow or flaky.
- The user asks for an audit of `tools/` or a specific subdirectory.

## Inputs

Caller passes a file path, a directory (`tools/linting/`, `tools/validation/`, `tools/standardization/`), or a request to audit everything.

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md` (especially pre-commit / CI divergence rules), plus tooling-specific files:

- `tools/shared_utils.py` — `Timer`, `create_linting_parser`, `collect_files_by_mode`, `get_root_dir`, `run_with_pool`, `get_git_diff_files`, `get_all_txt_files`, `print_timing_summary`, `FileOpener`.
- `tools/validation/validator_common.py` — `BaseValidator`, `_pool_map`, staged-file support.
- `tools/path_utils.py` — `clean_filepath`.
- `pyproject.toml` — single source for ruff (lint), pytest (testpaths), black, isort config.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — which scripts are hooks vs `stages: [manual]` vs unwired; the `ruff` hook and the `tools-pytest` pre-push hook.
- `.github/workflows/tools-validation.yml` — the `ruff-lint` job, the pytest job (runs all four test dirs), and `validate_tools.py --strict`.
- `.github/workflows/coding-pipeline.yml` — what CI runs unconditionally vs locally-only.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm scope** — list the files in review back to the caller.
2. **Read each file in full.**
3. **Run the toolchain** — `ruff check tools` must pass clean, and `python -m pytest` (all four test dirs) must be green. Quote the actual output; never claim green without running.
4. **Categorize findings** — Correctness > Duplication > Performance > Robustness > Consistency > Style.
5. **Verify pre-commit/CI wiring** — does the new validator belong in pre-commit, CI, both, or `stages: [manual]`?
6. **Report** — see output format.

## What to check / produce

**Duplication**:

- Re-implementing helpers that exist in `shared_utils.py` (file collection, argparse, Pool dispatch, root-dir resolution, git-diff).
- Near-identical logic across multiple scripts.
- Unused imports (`subprocess`, `argparse`, `fnmatch`, `logging`, `multiprocessing`).

**Performance**:

- Regex compiled inline per-line instead of at module level.
- `multiprocessing.Pool` for tiny file sets where sequential is faster.
- Full-repo walks in staged/pre-commit mode (should use `MD_STAGED_FILES`).
- Multiple `git diff --cached` subprocess calls when one would do.
- Unbounded caches.
- `errors="ignore"` on file open (silently drops bad bytes — use `errors="replace"` and warn).

**Robustness**:

- Missing `timeout=` on `subprocess.run`.
- Bare `except Exception` that swallows tracebacks.
- Silent failures (returning `None` / `[]` instead of reporting).
- Missing file-existence checks before open.

**Correctness**:

- Wrong directory list (some scripts must include `interface/`, others must not).
- `tag` vs `original_tag` misuse in the validator's own check logic.
- Off-by-one line numbers.
- Regex that doesn't match what it claims.
- Dead functions / unreferenced helpers.
- **Re-export trap.** `validator_common.py` and `shared_utils.py` import names purely to re-export them (e.g. `run_validator_main`, `strip_comments`); the downstream consumers do `from validator_common import X`. ruff/pyflakes can't see those consumers and flag the import as unused — an `--fix` will silently delete it and break ~30 importers. The hub/library modules carry a per-file `F401` ignore in `pyproject.toml`; never strip those imports or remove the ignore. For a one-off re-export elsewhere (a test importing a symbol through a validator), mark the line `# noqa: F401`.

**Tests (pytest)**:

- Any new or changed `validate_*.py` / `report_lib` logic needs matching tests in the right `tests/` dir (`tools/tests`, `tools/report_lib/tests`, `tools/validation/tests`, `tools/linting/tests`). The whole suite must stay green.
- New test files must end in `_test.py` (the `python_files` pattern in `pyproject.toml`); `test_*.py` is not collected.
- All four dirs run in CI and at `pre-push`. A test added only under a dir not in `testpaths` is dead — confirm placement.

**Consistency**:

- Uses `create_linting_parser()` / `collect_files_by_mode()` / `run_with_pool()` rather than rolling its own.
- Uses `Timer()` / `print_timing_summary()` for per-phase timing.
- Uses `get_root_dir()` not manual `os.path.dirname` chains.
- Worker count default: `max(1, min(os.cpu_count() or 2, 4))`.
- File opens always specify encoding: `"utf-8"` or `"utf-8-sig"`.

**Style**:

- stdlib-only for **runtime/shipped** tool deps (the validators and linters import only stdlib + the pinned `requests`/`pillow` in the `runtime` dependency-group in `pyproject.toml`). This does **not** apply to **dev tooling** — ruff and pytest are sanctioned dev dependencies in the `dev` dependency-group. All Python deps live in `pyproject.toml` under `[dependency-groups]` (no `requirements.txt`); ruff handles lint, import order, and formatting (black and isort were retired).
- Passes `ruff check` (config in `pyproject.toml`: `E`+`F`+`I`, with `E402`/`E741`/`E501` ignored) and `ruff format`. Don't reintroduce unused imports, bare `except:`, or unused variables.
- No comments that restate what the code does.
- Pre-compiled regex at module level.
- f-strings, not `.format()`.

**Wiring sanity**:

- Pre-commit-only hook? CI-only? Both? `stages: [manual]`? Confirm against `AGENTS.md` "Pre-commit vs CI divergence" section.
- New validator must declare `--strict` behavior explicitly.

## Output format

Standard reviewer output from `agent-conventions.md` — category groups: `Correctness`, `Duplication`, `Performance`, `Robustness`, `Consistency`, `Style`, `Tests`, `Wiring`. Lead with **Files reviewed** so the caller can audit scope, and state the `ruff` + `pytest` result.

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply. Plus:

- Do NOT introduce **runtime** pip dependencies — shipped tools stay stdlib + `requests`/`pillow`. (Dev tooling ruff/pytest/black/isort is fine.)
- Do NOT run `ruff --fix` blindly on the hub/library modules — see the re-export trap above.
- Do NOT claim ruff/pytest pass without running them and quoting the output.
- Do NOT wire a new validator to CI strict mode without first running it against the full repo and triaging existing hits.
