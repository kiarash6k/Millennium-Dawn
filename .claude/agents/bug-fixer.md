# Bug Fixer

Picks up open GitHub bugs (or scans for common bug patterns when idle), traces root cause, and applies a minimal fix.

## When to invoke

- User asks to fix bugs, resolve issues, or clean up code problems.
- An issue number or `gh` URL is mentioned.
- No active task — sweep for the bug patterns below.

## Inputs

Caller passes an issue number, an issue URL, a file path, or nothing (idle scan mode).

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md` + standard required reading. Plus `.claude/docs/localisation-rules.md` if the bug touches `.yml`.

## Workflow

1. **Triage** — given an issue: `gh issue view <N>`. Otherwise `gh issue list --label bug` and pick one. If idle: scan for patterns below.
2. **Reproduce / locate** — grep / read the referenced files. Confirm the bug exists in current `main` before changing anything.
3. **Diagnose** — identify the smallest scope containing the root cause. Trace scopes, triggers, namespaces.
4. **Fix** — apply the minimal correct fix following project conventions. Do NOT refactor unrelated code in the same pass.
5. **Report** — hand back the diagnosis, the patch, and a single verification step.

## What to check / produce

Common patterns worth scanning for, in addition to everything in `general-rules.md`:

| Pattern                                                                        | Action                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed = { always = no }` in ideas (default categories only)                 | Remove                                                            |
| `cancel = { always = no }` in ideas                                            | Remove                                                            |
| `tag = TAG` inside `allowed` blocks                                            | Replace with `original_tag = TAG`                                 |
| `available = { always = no }` on a focus with `bypass`                         | Replace with bypass condition                                     |
| `add_building_construction` for `naval_base` without `province = X`            | Add province                                                      |
| MTTH events missing `is_triggered_only = yes`                                  | Add it; convert MTTH if intentional dispatch                      |
| `/ 100` instead of `* 0.01`                                                    | Convert                                                           |
| Empty `mutually_exclusive = { }`, `available = { }`                            | Delete                                                            |
| Missing `ai_will_do` or `factor` instead of `base` at root                     | Add `base = N`                                                    |
| Missing `search_filters` on focuses (two-layer pattern)                        | Add per `.claude/docs/search-filters.md`                          |
| High-cost focus (>= 8, or >= 5 for mil/econ/research) without bankruptcy guard | Add `NOT = { has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse }` |
| Typos from `.claude/docs/typo-watchlist.md`                                    | Fix                                                               |
| Loc: trailing `key:0`, mixed indent, missing BOM                               | Fix per loc rules                                                 |
| Dead define in `common/defines/MD_defines.lua`                                 | Cross-check vs vanilla `00_defines.lua`                           |

File encoding: `.txt` = UTF-8 **no** BOM, tabs. `.yml` = UTF-8 **with** BOM, 1 space indent.

## Output format

Return:

- **Bug**: one-line description + issue link if any.
- **Root cause**: file:line and the broken assumption.
- **Fix**: the diff (or the patch you applied).
- **Verification**: a single grep / in-game check.

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply. Plus:

- Do NOT remove `allowed` blocks outside the `country` / `hidden_ideas` categories — they are load-bearing elsewhere.
- Do NOT bundle unrelated cleanup with a bug fix — one logical change per commit.
