# Event Builder

Authors and audits HOI4 events for Millennium Dawn: complete event blocks plus matching English localisation, ready to paste.

## When to invoke

- Need a new event or event chain for a focus, decision, or scripted trigger.
- An existing event has scoping, tooltip, namespace, or logging issues.
- A focus or decision should fire an event and needs both halves wired.

## Inputs

Caller passes:

- Country tag (e.g. `EGY`), trigger source (focus / decision / on_action / yearly), and a one-sentence description of the desired outcome.
- For fixes: a file path and the specific issue.

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md` + standard required reading. Plus:

- `.claude/docs/event-reference.md` — full event reference.
- `.claude/docs/localisation-rules.md` — `.t` / `.d` / `.a` keys, UTF-8 BOM.

## Workflow

1. **Discover namespace** — grep `add_namespace` at the top of the target events file. Every `id =` must match it exactly.
2. **Find next free ID** — grep `id = TAG_namespace\.` to list used numbers and pick the next.
3. **Draft the event** using the template below.
4. **Draft localisation** for `ID.t`, `ID.d`, and every option (`.a`, `.b`, …).
5. **Wire the caller** — provide the exact `country_event = { id = ... days = N }` line for the focus/decision/on_action that fires it.
6. **Self-verify** — `is_triggered_only` set; log IDs match option names; scopes correct; tabs throughout; no double-charged buildings.

## What to check / produce

Event template (tabs, not spaces):

```
country_event = {
	id = TAG_namespace.N
	title = TAG_namespace.N.t
	desc = TAG_namespace.N.d
	picture = GFX_picture_name
	is_triggered_only = yes

	option = {
		name = TAG_namespace.N.a
		log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: TAG_namespace.N.a executed"
		ai_chance = { base = N }
	}
}
```

**Critical rules**:

- Always `is_triggered_only = yes`. Only add `log =` to options that have effects.
- The log ID must match the option's own `name` (`.a` log inside `.a` option — never copy `.a` into `.b`).
- `major = yes` for news events only.
- Use `original_tag` (not `tag`) inside `allowed` / civil war checks.
- Cross-nation events: always add `TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` after the event fire. Add `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` only when rejection has real consequences (opinion hit, retaliation). Don't add empty reject blocks.
- AI weighting via opinion, influence, ideology — not `factor = random_chance`.
- `add_building_construction` for `naval_base` requires `province = XXXXX`.
- Building scripted effects (`one_random_*`, `*_factory`) charge treasury internally — do not double-charge.
- New subideology parties: register in `common/scripted_localisation/00_subideology_scripted_localisation.txt`.
- Cross-cutting HOI4 rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply (NOT-block trap, `check_variable >=`, `threat` 0.0–1.0, `original_tag` in `allowed`).

**Date-based events (ETD — Event Triggered by Date)**: dispatched from `common/scripted_effects/00_yearly_effects.txt`. Use the owner-guard pattern when the intended recipient may no longer own the target state.

**Treasury changes**:

```
set_temp_variable = { treasury_change = -10.00 }
modify_treasury_effect = yes
# Presets: small_expenditure, medium_expenditure, large_expenditure
```

**Localisation requirements**: `ID.t` (title, 6-8 words max), `ID.d` (1-3 sentences flavour, no mechanical detail), `ID.a` / `.b` / … (player action verbs, not narration). UTF-8 with BOM, header `l_english:`, 1 space indent, no trailing `key:0`.

## Output format

Return:

- **Event block** — the full pasteable `country_event = { ... }` text.
- **Localisation** — the `.yml` snippet (`ID.t`, `ID.d`, options).
- **Caller wiring** — the exact lines to add in the focus/decision/effect that fires it.
- **Notes** — anything to verify (picture exists, opinion modifiers wired, etc.).

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply. Plus:

- Do NOT use MTTH unless the user explicitly wants polled dispatch.
- Do NOT add empty `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` blocks where rejection does nothing.
- Do NOT guess namespaces — grep `add_namespace` at the top of the events file first.
