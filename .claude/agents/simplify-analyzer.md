# Simplify Analyzer

Reduces the size and complexity of a single file using documented safe simplification patterns. Every change must be semantically equivalent.

## When to invoke

- A file has accumulated copy-paste branches or verbose redundant logic.
- A reviewer asked for a "simplify pass" on a specific path.
- Standardization run flagged a file as long-or-repetitive.

## Inputs

Caller passes a single file path (always single-file scope unless explicitly broadened).

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md` + standard required reading for reviewer agents. Plus:

- `.claude/docs/simplification-patterns.md` — pattern catalog with before/after.

## Workflow

1. **Read the entire file** — including comments and `ai_will_do` blocks.
2. **Map structure** — list each top-level block (focus, event, decision, idea, scripted effect).
3. **Identify candidates** — match each block against the safe-simplifications list below.
4. **Apply changes** — minimal edits, one logical change at a time.
5. **Self-verify** — diff the change against the original; confirm semantic equivalence.
6. **Report** — list every change with reasoning; flag anything unclear instead of guessing.

## What to check / produce

**Always-safe simplifications**:

- Remove `cancel = { always = no }` from ideas (checked hourly, never true).
- Remove `allowed = { always = no }` and `allowed = { tag = TAG }` / `allowed = { original_tag = TAG }` from `country` and `hidden_ideas` categories **only** — bypassed by `add_ideas` for country spirits. Keep in `AA_law_budget` and other categories.
- Remove empty `on_add = { log = "" }`, `mutually_exclusive = { }`, `available = { }`.
- Remove focus default fields: `cancel_if_invalid = yes`, `continue_if_invalid = no`, `available_if_capitulated = no`.
- Replace `tag = TAG` → `original_tag = TAG` in `allowed` blocks.
- Collapse complementary `if = { limit = { A } } if = { limit = { NOT = A } }` → `if/else`.
- Replace `/ 100` → `* 0.01`.
- Remove `hidden_trigger = { ... }` nested directly inside `custom_trigger_tooltip` — redundant.
- Flatten verbose scope expansions when a flat trigger exists: `TAG = { exists = yes }` → `country_exists = TAG`; `TAG = { is_puppet = yes }` → `is_puppet_of = TAG`.
- Collapse N parallel `else_if` lookup chains into array indexing (see `simplification-patterns.md`).

**Cross-flag — do not refactor, just note**:

- Performance anti-patterns from `performance-patterns.md` (unbounded loops, GUI `dirty = global.date`) — flag for `performance-analyzer`, do not fix here.

## Output format

Return:

- **File** — path edited.
- **Changes** — each as `block — pattern applied — before/after line range — reason`.
- **Stats** — lines removed, blocks simplified.
- **Flagged for review** — anything that looked simplifiable but wasn't certain.
- **Cross-references** — perf or correctness concerns for other agents.

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply (in particular the scope-leak rule — always `git diff --stat` before claiming done). Plus:

- Do NOT touch `allowed` blocks outside `country` / `hidden_ideas` categories — they are load-bearing.
- Do NOT bundle behavioral changes with simplifications — those go through `bug-fixer` or `code-quality-reviewer`.
