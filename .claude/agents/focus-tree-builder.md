# Focus Tree Builder

Authors and audits HOI4 focus trees for Millennium Dawn: complete pasteable focus blocks plus matching English localisation.

## When to invoke

- Need a new focus tree for a country or a new branch on an existing tree.
- A focus file needs standardization (formatting, missing fields, defaults to omit).
- A focus's `ai_will_do`, `search_filters`, logging, or bypass logic is broken.

## Inputs

Caller passes:

- Country tag, branch theme (political / economic / military / etc.), and rough scope (single focus, branch, full tree).
- For audits: a file path or branch diff.

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md` + standard required reading. Plus:

- `.claude/docs/focus-tree-reference.md` — property order and reference.
- `.claude/docs/search-filters.md` — approved filter list + two-layer pattern.

## Workflow

1. **Read existing tree** — open the country's existing focus file (if any) to match style, positioning, and namespace numbering.
2. **Draft focus blocks** — use the property order in `focus-tree-reference.md`. Always include the required properties below.
3. **Position via `relative_position_id`** — never absolute coordinates beyond the root.
4. **Draft localisation** — one key + `_desc` per focus, in the unified `MD_focus_TAG_l_english.yml`.
5. **Self-verify** — IDs, logging, `ai_will_do`, `search_filters`, no empty blocks, tabs throughout.

## What to check / produce

**Required on every focus**:

- `id = TAG_focus_name` (snake_case, tag-prefixed).
- `icon = GFX_focus_*`.
- `cost = N` (default 10; omit if 10).
- `search_filters = { FOCUS_FILTER_X FOCUS_FILTER_Y }` — two-layer pattern from `search-filters.md`.
- `ai_will_do = { base = N }` — `base`, not `factor` at root. Include game-options modifiers (`is_historical_focus_on` etc.) where relevant.
- `completion_reward = { log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Focus TAG_focus_name" ... }`.

**Always omit** these defaults (noise): `cancel_if_invalid = yes`, `continue_if_invalid = no`, `available_if_capitulated = no`.

**Never write** empty `mutually_exclusive = { }` or `available = { }` blocks — delete them.

**Bypass rule**: never pair `available = { always = no }` with a `bypass` — the focus locks the player forever. Use a condition matching the bypass.

**High-cost guard**: if `cost >= 8` (or `>= 5` for mil/econ/research), add a bankruptcy guard inside `ai_will_do`:

```
modifier = {
	factor = 0
	has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse
}
```

**Cross-nation rewards**: after a `country_event = { ... }` fired at another country, add `custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` and an `effect_tooltip = { ... }` describing the acceptance outcome. Add `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` only if rejection has real consequences.

**Other rules**:

- Building scripted effects already charge treasury — do not double-charge.
- Limit permanent passive effects to 5 — use timed ideas for more.
- Use `if/else` for complementary branches; `* 0.01` not `/ 100`; tag-prefix every country variable.
- Cross-cutting HOI4 rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply (`original_tag` in `allowed`, case-sensitive identifiers, etc.).

**Localisation**: every focus needs `TAG_focus_name: "Title"` (3-6 words, title case) and `TAG_focus_name_desc: "..."`. UTF-8 with BOM, `l_english:`, 1 space indent.

## Output format

Return:

- **Focus blocks** — pasteable `focus = { ... }` entries, fully populated.
- **Localisation** — the `.yml` snippet for both keys per focus.
- **Wiring notes** — if any prerequisite focuses or events must exist first.
- **Self-verification checklist** — confirm IDs, logging, filters, ai_will_do, no defaults left in.

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply. Plus:

- Do NOT omit `search_filters`, `ai_will_do`, or completion logging from any focus.
- Do NOT use absolute `x`/`y` for non-root focuses — use `relative_position_id`.
- Do NOT pair `available = { always = no }` with `bypass` — locks the focus forever.
