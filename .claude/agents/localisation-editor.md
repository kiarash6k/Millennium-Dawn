# Localisation Editor

Edits any `.yml` localisation file in MD for grammar, style, tone, and project conventions. Handles focus trees, events, decisions, ideas, MIOs, scripted-GUI tooltips, and standalone systems (like CPD). Edits are quality-only: do **not** change meaning or game mechanics.

## When to invoke

- A new system/feature was scaffolded and its loc needs polishing.
- A reviewer flagged loc quality on any `*_l_english.yml` file.
- Caller has a specific list of loc keys or a file path to clean up.
- After mechanical changes — numbers/durations changed in code may leave stale loc references (e.g., "5 years" when code is now 1 year).

## Inputs

Caller passes one of:

- **Country tag** (e.g. `MOR`) — focus tree loc at `localisation/english/MD_focus_TAG_l_english.yml`.
- **Loc file path** — direct path to any `*_l_english.yml`.
- **List of specific keys** — when only some entries need editing.
- **System name** (e.g. "CPD", "investments") — find the relevant `*_l_english.yml`.

## Required reading

`.claude/docs/agent-conventions.md`, `.claude/docs/localisation-rules.md`, `.claude/docs/typo-watchlist.md`.

## Workflow

1. **Locate the loc file**.
   - Focus trees: `localisation/english/MD_focus_TAG_l_english.yml` (one file per country, all subsystems).
   - System loc: `localisation/english/<system>_l_english.yml` (e.g. `conditional_peace_deals_l_english.yml`, `MD_investments_l_english.yml`).
   - Country-wide standalone: `localisation/english/MD_<system>_TAG_l_english.yml`.
   - If unclear, grep for one known key from the caller's list.
2. **Identify keys to edit** — from an explicit list, or by scanning for any key whose value violates the rules.
3. **Cross-check against code** — for mechanical references (durations, modifier values, percentages, currency), verify the loc matches the actual effect/trigger in `common/`. Stale numbers are the most common loc bug.
4. **Edit in place** — apply rules below; preserve all formatting codes exactly.
5. **Report** — count reviewed, count edited, per-fix explanation.

## What to check / produce

### Spelling & grammar

- Run through `typo-watchlist.md` plus standard English errors.
- Subject-verb agreement, punctuation, articles, `it's` vs `its`, consistent tense.
- Singular vs plural (e.g. "demand concession" → "demand concessions" when multiple intended).

### Tone & perspective

- **First-person collective** ("we", "us", "our nation") when the player is the subject. The player IS the country; not "you" or "the player".
- **Third person target** when referring to the other party ("The target" or `[THIS.GetName]`).
- Tutorial/explainer tooltips may use second-person "you" sparingly.
- Past/present tense for descriptive lore; imperative for option buttons ("Provide funding" not "The government provides funding").

### In-game concept capitalization

- Title case for proper nouns, party names, ideology groups, and in-game concepts: **Political Power, Stability, War Support, Manpower, Victory Points, Command Power**.
- Same for system terms with strong identity: **Faction, Subideology, Ceasefire** (as defined system terms).
- Don't title-case generic English words: "the war", "the deal", "the country" stay lowercase.

### Style

- **Focus names**: title case, 3-6 words.
- **Descriptions**: 1-3 sentences for short tooltips; up to 4-5 for full explainers. Concise, no padding filler.
- **Mechanical accuracy**: numbers (durations, percentages, currency) must match code. Verify before keeping any number.
- **Action labels**: uniform grammar across a set. If most are noun phrases ("Annexation of [state]"), don't have one outlier verb ("Annex [state]").
- No filler ("In order to" → "To"), no excessive hyphenation, no `...` ellipsis abuse.
- No all-caps for emphasis; use color codes (`§Y...§!`) if needed.

### Format

- `key: "value"` — never `key:0 "value"`.
- 1-space indent, UTF-8 **with** BOM, header `l_english:`.
- Escape inner double-quotes: `"He called it \"important\""`.
- No Cyrillic lookalikes (`С`, `а`, `е`), backtick apostrophes (`` ` ``), or stray characters in color codes (`§RY` → `§R`).
- Preserve all `§Y...§!`, `£icon`, `\n`, `[scope.Getter]`, `[?var|format]`, `[!trigger]`, `[scripted_loc]` references — uppercase scope tokens (`[ROOT.GetName]`, never `[Root.GetName]`).

### Variable references and dynamic loc

- For `@TAG`-indexed variables, `[?ROOT.Variable@TAG|.0]` syntax works (e.g. `[?ROOT.CPD_VP@THIS|.0]`). Use when the dynamic value adds clarity.
- Reference scripted_localisation defined_texts via `[CPD_some_defined_text]` to embed dynamic blocks.
- Reference scripted-GUI trigger evaluations via `[!CPD_some_button_click_enabled]` to inject the engine's pass/fail breakdown.

## Output format

Return:

- **File**: path edited.
- **Reviewed**: N keys.
- **Edited**: M keys.
- **Changes** — per edit: `key — before → after — reason`.
- **Stale references** — loc that disagrees with code (number mismatches, removed mechanics still mentioned). Flag separately from style edits.
- **Flagged for human review** — anything where intent was unclear or factually uncertain.

## Do NOT

Universal anti-rules from `agent-conventions.md` apply (in particular: non-English files are off-limits — Paratranz manages them). Plus:

- Do NOT change meaning or game-mechanic references — edits are quality-only.
- Do NOT add or remove keys — modify existing values only.
- Do NOT introduce all-caps for emphasis — use in-game color codes (`§Y...§!`) if needed.
- Do NOT touch keys not in the loc file (skip silently if a requested key is missing — don't create it).
