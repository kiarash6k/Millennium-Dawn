Audit a country's content branch against the focus tree lifecycle checklist and report which phases are done or missing.

**Syntax:** `/lifecycle-check [TAG]`

- With `TAG`: check all required files for that specific country tag.
- Without argument: infer the TAG from the current branch name or changed files.

The authoritative checklist is `docs/src/content/resources/focus-tree-lifecycle-checklist.md`. Read it before starting.

## Execution

### 1. Determine the TAG

If TAG is provided, use it directly (uppercase). Otherwise run:

```
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
```

and infer the TAG from the most frequently changed country-specific prefix.

### 2. Check each lifecycle item

For each item mark **Done**, **Missing**, or **Partial** (file exists but seems incomplete, e.g. an empty stub).

#### Drafting Phase

Cannot be checked from files. Mark "not verifiable from code" and remind the user that draft approval must happen before coding.
