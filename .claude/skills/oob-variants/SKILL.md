Reference guide for editing OOB (Order of Battle) files and equipment variants in Millennium Dawn. For valid equipment types and modifiers, see `resources/documentation/modifiers_documentation.md` and `resources/documentation/effects_documentation.md`.

This skill is not invocable — it documents patterns and conventions for OOB and variant work.

## File Structure

### OOB Files (`history/units/`)

Each country has multiple OOB files gated by DLC:

| Pattern                  | DLC Gate       | Content                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `TAG_YEAR_nsb.txt`       | No Step Back   | Ground units (divisions, templates) |
| `TAG_YEAR_nonnsb.txt`    | Fallback       | Legacy ground units                 |
| `TAG_YEAR_bba.txt`       | By Blood Alone | Air units (airframes, wings)        |
| `TAG_YEAR_nonbba.txt`    | Fallback       | Legacy air units                    |
| `TAG_YEAR_naval_mtg.txt` | Man the Guns   | Naval fleets (ships, task forces)   |

The country history file (`history/countries/TAG - Name.txt`) sets which OOB to use:

```
set_oob = "TAG_2000_nsb"         # Ground
set_naval_oob = "TAG_2000_naval_mtg"  # Naval
set_air_oob = "TAG_2000_bba"    # Air
```

### Equipment Variants (`history/countries/TAG - Name.txt`)

Variants are defined inside the `2000.1.1` date block, typically gated by DLC:

```
if = {
    limit = { has_dlc = "No Step Back" }
    # NSB tank/vehicle variants here
}
if = {
    limit = { has_dlc = "By Blood Alone" }
    # BBA aircraft variants here
}
```

## Equipment Variant Patterns

### Tank / Vehicle Variant

```
create_equipment_variant = {
    name = "T-64B"
    type = medium_tank_chassis_1          # chassis type + generation
    parent_version = 0                     # base version to derive from
    modules = {
        main_armament_slot = tank_medium_cannon_2
        ammunition_load_slot = mixed_main_ammo_2
        turret_type_slot = tank_soviet_turret
        suspension_type_slot = tank_torsion_bar_suspension_medium
        armor_type_slot = tank_composite_armor_gen2
        engine_type_slot = tank_diesel_engine_gen2
        reload_type_slot = automatic_loading
        special_type_slot_1 = smoke_launchers
        special_type_slot_2 = empty
        special_type_slot_3 = smoothbore_atgm_gen1
        special_type_slot_4 = tank_battlestation_2
        special_type_slot_6 = reactive_armor_gen1   # optional ERA
    }
    upgrades = {
        tank_nsb_armor_upgrade = 2
    }
    obsolete = yes                         # mark if not in active production
    icon = "gfx/interface/technologies/TAG/LAND/image.dds"
    model = "entity_name"
}
```

### Chassis Types

Source: `common/units/equipment/MD_x_tank_chassis.txt`

| Chassis                            | In-Game Role                    | Equipment IDs                                   | Example Vehicles                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `medium_tank_chassis_N`            | MBT (Main Battle Tank)          | MBT_1 – MBT_8                                   | T-64, T-84, Leopard 2, M1 Abrams  |
| `medium_tank_amphibious_chassis_N` | APC (Wheeled/Tracked APC)       | APC_1 – APC_8                                   | BTR-3, BTR-60, MT-LB, M113        |
| `medium_tank_flame_chassis_N`      | IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) | IFV_1 – IFV_8                                   | BMP-2, BMP-3, Bradley, Marder     |
| `medium_tank_artillery_chassis_N`  | SP Artillery                    | SP_arty_0 – SP_arty_4                           | 2S1 Gvozdika, 2S19 Msta, PzH 2000 |
| `medium_tank_rocket_chassis_N`     | MLRS / Rocket Artillery         | SP_R_arty_0 – SP_R_arty_4                       | BM-27 Uragan, M270 MLRS           |
| `medium_tank_aa_chassis_N`         | SPAA (Self-Propelled Anti-Air)  | SP_Anti_Air_0 – SP_Anti_Air_4                   | ZSU-23-4, Tunguska, Gepard        |
| `medium_tank_destroyer_chassis_N`  | Recon Tank / Light Tank         | Rec_tank_0 – Rec_tank_5                         | BRDM, AMX-10RC, Stryker           |
| `heavy_tank_chassis_N`             | Attack Helicopter               | attack_helicopter_1 – attack_helicopter_5       | Mi-24, AH-64 Apache, Ka-52        |
| `heavy_tank_amphibious_chassis_N`  | Transport Helicopter            | transport_helicopter_1 – transport_helicopter_5 | Mi-8, UH-60 Black Hawk, CH-47     |

**Generation mapping (medium_tank_chassis MBT):**

| Equipment ID | Year | Gen (`_N` suffix)       |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| MBT_1        | 1965 | `medium_tank_chassis_0` |
| MBT_2        | 1975 | `medium_tank_chassis_1` |
| MBT_3        | 1985 | `medium_tank_chassis_2` |
| MBT_4        | 1995 | `medium_tank_chassis_3` |
| MBT_5        | 2015 | `medium_tank_chassis_4` |
| MBT_7        | 2025 | `medium_tank_chassis_5` |
| MBT_8        | 2035 | `medium_tank_chassis_6` |

**APC/IFV (same pattern):** APC_1/IFV_1 = `_0` (1965), APC_2/IFV_2 = `_1` (1975), etc. through `_7` (2035).

**Notes:**

- Despite HOI4 naming (`flame`, `amphibious`, `destroyer`), MD repurposes these chassis types for modern vehicle roles as shown above.
- Attack and transport helicopters use `heavy_tank_chassis` / `heavy_tank_amphibious_chassis` — land equipment, not air.
- SP Arty, MLRS, SPAA have 5 tiers (0–4) vs MBT/APC/IFV 8 tiers (1–8). Recon tanks: 6 tiers (0–5). Helicopters: 5 tiers (1–5).

### Key Tank Modules

**Main guns** (generation matters for historical accuracy):

- `tank_medium_cannon` — Gen 1 (e.g., 2A26M2 on T-64A/B)
- `tank_medium_cannon_2` — Gen 2 (e.g., 2A46M on T-72B, T-80U, T-84)

**Ammo:**

- `mixed_main_ammo_1` — Gen 1 (T-64A/B era rounds)
- `mixed_main_ammo_2` — Gen 2 (improved rounds)

**ATGMs:**

- `smoothbore_atgm_gen1` — Gen 1 (9M112 Kobra)
- `smoothbore_atgm_gen2` — Gen 2 (9M119 Svir basic)
- `smoothbore_atgm_gen3` — Gen 3 (9K120 Svir/Refleks, Kombat)

**Armor:**

- `tank_composite_armor_gen1` / `gen2` — Composite armor generations
- `reactive_armor_gen1` — ERA (e.g., Kontakt-1 on T-64BV)
- `reactive_armor_gen2` — Improved ERA (e.g., Nozh on T-64BM Bulat)

**Engines:**

- `tank_diesel_engine_gen1` through `gen4` — Diesel engine generations
- `tank_turbine_engine_gen1` through `gen2` — Gas turbine engines

Carrier variants (CV prefix):

| Airframe                                   | Base Archetype             | Role                    | Equipment IDs          |

**Medium multirole equipment (uses base `medium_plane_airframe` directly):**

- Multirole fighters: MR_Fighter1–7 (carrier: CV_MR_Fighter1–7)
- Strike fighters: Strike_fighter1–7

**Generation mapping for aircraft airframes** (applies to all archetype + generation combinations like `small_plane_strike_airframe_N`):

| Generation Suffix | Tech Required | Start Year | Example Variants                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `_0`              | `gen_3_*`     | 1960       | Early jets (F-4, MiG-21, J 35 Draken)              |
| `_1`              | `gen_3_*`     | 1960       | 1960s variants (A-4, F-104, JA 37 Viggen)          |
| `_2`              | `gen_4_*`     | 1980       | 1980s variants (F-16A, F/A-18A, JAS 39 Gripen A/B) |
| `_3`              | `gen_5_*`     | 2015       | 2010s variants (F-16C, JAS 39E Gripen)             |
| `_4`              | `gen_6_*`     | 2025       | Future variants                                    |
| `_5`              | `gen_7_*`     | 2035       | Endgame variants                                   |

**Important:** The generation suffix (`_0`, `_1`, `_2`, etc.) must match a technology that unlocks that equipment type. E.g., `small_plane_strike_airframe_2` requires `gen_4_light`. If you create `type = small_plane_strike_airframe_3` but the country lacks `gen_5_light`, the variant exists but cannot be produced or added to stockpile.

### Aircraft Variant (BBA)

```
create_equipment_variant = { #Large Transport
    name = "An-26"
    type = large_plane_air_transport_airframe_1
    parent_version = 1
    modules = {
        fixed_main_weapon_slot = weap_buff_transport
        fixed_gun_slot = empty
        engine_type_slot = engine_prop_double_1
        avionics_type_slot = avionics_manned_1
        wingform_type_slot = wing_straight
        special_slot_type_1 = empty
        special_slot_type_2 = empty
        special_slot_type_3 = empty
        fixed_auxiliary_weapon_slot_1 = empty
        fixed_auxiliary_weapon_slot_2 = empty
    }
    obsolete = yes
    icon = "gfx/interface/technologies/TAG/AIR/image.dds"
}
```

## Stockpile & Deployment

### Adding to Stockpile

See [Stockpile Equipment Types](#stockpile-equipment-types-nsb-vs-non-nsb) below for complete syntax. Quick example:

```
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = medium_tank_chassis_1
    variant_name = "T-64B"
    amount = 500
    producer = UKR
}
```

### Air Wings (deployed in BBA OOB file)

```
696 = { #Kharkiv
    small_plane_airframe_2 = { owner = "UKR" creator = "SOV" amount = 50 version_name = "MiG-29 Fulcrum" }
    name = "8-yi Vynyshchuvalnyi Aviatsiynyi Polk"
    start_experience_factor = 0.4
}
```

The state ID is the deployment location. `owner` is current owner, `creator` is who built it (affects variant lookup).

## Naval OOB

### Ship Entry

```
ship = { name = "Hetman Sahaydachnyi" definition = frigate start_experience_factor = 0.50 equipment = { frigate_hull_1 = { amount = 1 owner = UKR creator = UKR version_name = "Krivak III Class" } } }
```

- `definition` = ship class (frigate, corvette, cruiser, submarine, etc.)
- `creator` = who defined the variant (often SOV for Soviet-era ships inherited by successor states)
- `version_name` must match a `create_equipment_variant` with that `name` in the creator country's history file

### Ship Hulls

Source: `common/units/equipment/MD_mtg_ships.txt`

**Screen Ships:**

| Hull                       | Type           | Tiers          | Year Range | Role                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `corvette_hull_N`          | `screen_ship`  | 1–6            | 1965–2040  | Corvettes, patrol boats (Grisha, Tarantul, Pauk)  |
| `stealth_corvette_hull_N`  | `screen_ship`  | 1–3            | 2010–2040  | Stealth corvettes (higher cost, lower visibility) |
| `frigate_hull_N`           | `screen_ship`  | 1–6            | 1965–2040  | Frigates (Krivak, Oliver Hazard Perry)            |
| `stealth_frigate_hull_N`   | `screen_ship`  | 1–3            | 2010–2040  | Stealth frigates                                  |
| `heavy_frigate`            | `screen_ship`  | archetype only | 2010       | Heavy frigate upgrade (higher cost)               |
| `destroyer_hull_N`         | `screen_ship`  | 1–5            | 1965–2045  | Destroyers (Arleigh Burke, Sovremenny)            |
| `stealth_destroyer_hull_N` | `capital_ship` | 1–3            | 2015–2040  | Stealth destroyers (Zumwalt-type)                 |

**Capital Ships:**

| Hull                         | Type           | Tiers | Year Range | Role                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `cruiser_hull_N`             | `capital_ship` | 1–5   | 1965–2040  | Cruisers (Slava, Ticonderoga)              |
| `battle_cruiser_hull_N`      | `capital_ship` | 1–4   | 1965–2025  | Battlecruisers (Kirov class)               |
| `battleship_hull_N`          | `capital_ship` | 0–4   | 1965–2025  | Battleships (Iowa class, Yamato)           |
| `helicopter_operator_hull_N` | `carrier`      | 1–4   | 1970–2025  | Helicopter carriers / LHDs (Mistral, Wasp) |
| `carrier_hull_N`             | `carrier`      | 1–5   | 1965–2040  | Aircraft carriers (Nimitz, Kuznetsov)      |

**Submarines:**

| Hull                       | Type        | Tiers | Year Range | Role                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `attack_submarine_hull_N`  | `submarine` | 1–6   | 1965–2040  | Attack submarines (Los Angeles, Akula, Kilo) |
| `missile_submarine_hull_N` | `submarine` | 1–6   | 1965–2040  | Missile submarines / SSBNs (Ohio, Typhoon)   |

**OOB `definition` field values:** maps to these roles: `corvette`, `frigate`, `destroyer`, `cruiser`, `battle_cruiser`, `battleship`, `helicopter_operator`, `carrier`, `submarine` (for both attack and missile subs).

**Notes:**

- Stealth variants have much lower `surface_visibility` but higher build cost and use `composites` instead of `aluminium`.
- Battleship uses `battleship_hull_0` as its archetype (not a separate named archetype) — an `is_archetype = yes` hull.
- Ship hulls have zero intrinsic combat stats — all offense/defense comes from modules.
- Armor is zeroed out across all hulls; CIWS modules provide missile defense instead.

### Production Queue (in-progress builds)

```
instant_effect = {
    add_equipment_production = {
        equipment = {
            type = corvette_hull_2
            creator = "UKR"
            version_name = "Grisha V Class"
        }
        requested_factories = 1      # 0 = paused
        progress = 0.80              # 80% complete
        efficiency = 30
        amount = 1
    }
}
```

## Equipment Bonuses in Ideas

When adding production bonuses in `common/ideas/`, target the **chassis archetype**, not individual equipment IDs. Each chassis type is independent for bonus purposes:

```
equipment_bonus = {
    medium_tank_chassis = { build_cost_ic = -0.03 }              # MBTs only
    medium_tank_amphibious_chassis = { build_cost_ic = -0.03 }   # APCs only
    medium_tank_flame_chassis = { build_cost_ic = -0.03 }        # IFVs only
}
```

A country with MBT bonuses does NOT automatically get APC or IFV bonuses — each must be listed separately.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Creator mismatch**: If a ship/plane uses `creator = SOV`, the variant must be defined in `SOV - Russia.txt`, not the country's own file. Countries that inherited Soviet equipment typically use `creator = SOV`.

2. **Tech requirements**: A country must have the tech for a chassis/airframe type before it can use variants of that type. Check the country's `set_technology` block.

3. **Module availability**: Modules like `smoothbore_atgm_gen3` require the corresponding tech (e.g., `nsb_special_ammo_1`). Verify the country has it before assigning the module.

4. **Obsolete flag**: Set `obsolete = yes` on older variants so AI doesn't try to produce them. Only the newest/best variant should lack this flag.

5. **Production bonuses**: Equipment bonuses in ideas target chassis types, not individual variants. If a country has `medium_tank_chassis` bonuses but not `medium_tank_amphibious_chassis` or `medium_tank_flame_chassis`, IFVs/APCs won't benefit.

6. **Hull generation mismatch**: The hull type in the OOB (`corvette_hull_1`, etc.) must match the `type` in the variant's `create_equipment_variant` block. Mismatch logs `"does not have any equipment variant for type X version 0"`. To diagnose: find the `version_name` in the OOB, grep for that name in the creator country's history file, compare the `type` field. Fix by changing the hull in the OOB to match the variant definition.

7. **DLC gating**: Always place NSB variants inside `has_dlc = "No Step Back"` blocks and BBA variants inside `has_dlc = "By Blood Alone"` blocks. Provide fallback content in `else` blocks.

8. **Helicopter chassis confusion**: Attack and transport helicopters use `heavy_tank_chassis` and `heavy_tank_amphibious_chassis` respectively — land equipment despite being aircraft. Don't confuse these with actual heavy tank or amphibious tank variants.

9. **Transport airframe type**: Both `medium_plane_air_transport_airframe` and `large_plane_air_transport_airframe` use HOI4 type `suicide` internally (engine quirk). Normal — don't change it.

10. **NSB vs Non-NSB Stockpile Types**: NSB and non-NSB OOB files use completely different equipment type systems. See "Stockpile Equipment Types" section below.

11. **Aircraft variant name mismatches in events**: Events that create aircraft variants AND add them to stockpile must use matching names. A common bug is creating `"Variant A"` but adding `"Variant B"` to stockpile — the stockpile addition silently fails. Verify the `create_equipment_variant` name matches the `add_equipment_to_stockpile` variant_name.

12. **Aircraft parent_version must chain correctly**: The first variant of any equipment type must have `parent_version = 0`. Setting `parent_version = 1` when no version 0 exists can prevent the variant from spawning. Each subsequent variant increments from an existing parent.

13. **BBA OOB stockpile must be uncommented**: Air wings in BBA OOB files reference variants by name; if the `add_equipment_to_stockpile` block is commented out or missing, the air wings have no equipment to deploy. Verify stockpile entries exist for all variants referenced in air_wings.

14. **Higher-generation aircraft variants require technology unlock**: Using `small_plane_strike_airframe_3` (gen 3, 2015+) requires `gen_5_light`. If an event creates a gen 3 variant but doesn't grant the tech, the equipment type isn't unlocked and stockpile additions fail. Add `set_technology = { gen_X_Y = 1 }` when introducing advanced variants via event/focus.

15. **BBA/non-BBA event consistency**: Events that add aircraft should have both BBA and non-BBA branches. Use `if = { limit = { has_dlc = "By Blood Alone" } }` for BBA variants with `variant_name`, and `else` for legacy types like `MR_Fighter3`. Don't only add the legacy type — BBA players get nothing.

## Module Technology Validation

Pitfalls 2, 3, and 14 above are enforced automatically. `validate_history.py` builds a module → enabling-tech map from every `enable_equipment_modules` block in `common/technologies/` and reports any `create_equipment_variant` using a module without the enabling tech in the country's `set_technology` block. It also checks each granted tech's prerequisite chain, is DLC-aware, checks OOB references and capital definitions, and runs in CI.

When adding or editing a variant, grant the enabling tech in the matching block:

- Naval and base-game techs → the plain, un-DLC-gated `set_technology` block.
- No Step Back techs → `set_technology` inside `if = { limit = { has_dlc = "No Step Back" } }`.
- By Blood Alone techs → `set_technology` inside `if = { limit = { has_dlc = "By Blood Alone" } }`.

Also grant the tech's prerequisites (whatever `leads_to_tech` it), or the prerequisite check fails. Run the validator before committing variant changes:

```bash
python3 tools/validation/validate_history.py --strict
```

### Inherited-Technology Countries

The release-only nations Alaska (ASK), Confederate States (CSA), Great Lakes Confederation (GLC) and New England (NEN) inherit their technology from the United States when they spawn. Their history files still carry an explicit `set_technology` block matching the equipment variants they define, so the designs stay valid and the validator passes whether the country is inspected at game start or after release. Keep that block in sync with their variants — inheritance happens at spawn and does not satisfy the static check.

## Stockpile Equipment Types (NSB vs Non-NSB)

> **Quick Reference**: For a condensed version of this section, see `.claude/docs/oob-equipment-reference.md`.

The `add_equipment_to_stockpile` entries in OOB files must use different type systems depending on which OOB file you're editing:

### NSB Files (`*_nsb.txt`)

NSB OOB files use **chassis types** with `variant_name` to reference specific equipment variants:

```
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = medium_tank_chassis_1           # chassis type + generation
    variant_name = "T-72B"                  # must match variant's "name" field
    amount = 100
    producer = SOV                          # who built it
}
```

The `variant_name` must exactly match the `name` in the `create_equipment_variant` block defined in `history/countries/TAG - Name.txt`.

### Non-NSB Files (`*_nonnsb.txt`)

Non-NSB OOB files use **legacy equipment IDs** without variant names:

```
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = MBT_2           # legacy equipment ID
    amount = 100
    producer = GER
}
```

**Do NOT use `variant_name`** in non-NSB stockpile entries — it has no effect.

### Equipment Type Mapping

| Vehicle Role         | NSB Chassis Type                   | Non-NSB Legacy ID                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MBT                  | `medium_tank_chassis_N`            | `MBT_1` – `MBT_8`                                   |
| APC                  | `medium_tank_amphibious_chassis_N` | `APC_1` – `APC_8`                                   |
| IFV                  | `medium_tank_flame_chassis_N`      | `IFV_1` – `IFV_8`                                   |
| Recon/Tank Destroyer | `medium_tank_destroyer_chassis_N`  | `Rec_tank_0` – `Rec_tank_5`                         |
| SP Artillery         | `medium_tank_artillery_chassis_N`  | `SP_arty_0` – `SP_arty_4`                           |
| SP Rocket Artillery  | `medium_tank_rocket_chassis_N`     | `SP_R_arty_0` – `SP_R_arty_4`                       |
| SP Anti-Air          | `medium_tank_aa_chassis_N`         | `SP_Anti_Air_0` – `SP_Anti_Air_4`                   |
| Towed Artillery      | `artillery_N`                      | `artillery_0` – `artillery_4`                       |
| Attack Helicopter    | `heavy_tank_chassis_N`             | `attack_helicopter_1` – `attack_helicopter_5`       |
| Transport Helicopter | `heavy_tank_amphibious_chassis_N`  | `transport_helicopter_1` – `transport_helicopter_5` |

**Generation mapping**: The `_N` suffix maps the same way in both systems:

- `_0` = Gen 1 (1965) → `MBT_1`, `APC_1`, `IFV_1`, etc.
- `_1` = Gen 2 (1975) → `MBT_2`, `APC_2`, `IFV_2`, etc.

### Common Type/Variant Mismatches

When `add_equipment_to_stockpile` specifies a `variant_name`, the `type` must match what was used in `create_equipment_variant`. Common errors:

| Wrong                                                                 | Correct                                                                    | Issue                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type = medium_tank_flame_chassis_0`, `variant_name = "Grizzly AVGP"` | `type = medium_tank_amphibious_chassis_1`, `variant_name = "AVGP Grizzly"` | Grizzly is an APC (amphibious_chassis), not IFV (flame_chassis)          |
| `type = APC_2` (in NSB file)                                          | `type = medium_tank_amphibious_chassis_1`                                  | Legacy ID in NSB file                                                    |
| `type = medium_tank_amphibious_chassis_1` (in non-NSB file)           | `type = APC_2`                                                             | Chassis type in non-NSB file                                             |
| `type = medium_tank_chassis_0`, `variant_name = "Leopard 2A4"`        | `type = medium_tank_chassis_2`, `variant_name = "Leopard 2A4"`             | Wrong generation — Leopard 2 is 1980s (chassis_2), not 1960s (chassis_0) |

### Verifying Variant Consistency

To check if a stockpile entry matches its variant definition:

1. Find the `variant_name` in the OOB file
2. Search for it in `history/countries/TAG - Name.txt`: `grep "variant_name" history/countries/TAG\ -\ Name.txt`
3. Verify the `type` field matches between the `create_equipment_variant` block and the OOB stockpile entry
4. For inherited equipment (e.g., Soviet gear), check the `producer` country — the variant must be defined there, not in the inheriting country

**Example diagnostic workflow:**

```bash
# OOB says: type = medium_tank_chassis_0, variant_name = "T-72B"
# But equipment doesn't appear in-game

# Check if variant exists and what type it uses
grep -A2 'name = "T-72B"' history/countries/SOV\ -\ Russia.txt
# Output should show: type = medium_tank_chassis_1 (or similar)

# If mismatch found, update OOB to match
type = medium_tank_chassis_1  # corrected
```
