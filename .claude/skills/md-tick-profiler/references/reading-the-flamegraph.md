# Reading the tick profiler — interpretation & FAQ

Everything here is produced by `tools/analysis/tick_audit.py` (tests in
`tools/tests/tick_audit_test.py`). Read this before explaining *why* a number
looks the way it does.

## 1. Engine facts

HOI4 natively fires six recurring `on_action` hooks, and only these run on a
clock:

- `on_daily`, `on_weekly`, `on_monthly` — **global**: they run once **per
  country, per period**, and the engine **staggers** them across the period
  (not every country on the same day) to spread load.
- `on_daily_<TAG>`, `on_weekly_<TAG>`, `on_monthly_<TAG>` — run only for that
  one country.

`on_monthly` *is* native (vanilla uses it too) — it is not a custom MD bridge.
Everything that "runs every day/week/month" hangs off one of these six; the tool
finds them by parsing `common/on_actions/` and treats a hook's `scope` as
GLOBAL or the TAG, regardless of which file it's written in (a global
`on_weekly` can live inside `99_LBA_on_actions.txt`, and the tool still reports
it as GLOBAL — file location ≠ scope).

## 2. What "ops" is and isn't

`ops` = count of `key = ...` statements. That deliberately includes both
effects (`set_variable`, `add_to_variable`, `country_event`, ...) **and** the
`limit`/trigger checks the engine evaluates every tick. The user literally asked
about "checks", and checks cost CPU, so counting them is correct.

- A node's `ops` (its "self") = statements directly in its body.
- A node's `total` = self + the total of everything it calls (bar size uses
  `total`).
- It is a **proxy**, not milliseconds. The in-game profiler measures real ms but
  crashes on MD; ops is the static stand-in. Never present ops as time.

## 3. Call tree vs the flat report

The **flamegraph** is a call *tree*: a shared effect reached from three hooks is
counted three times (once per path) — this is how a profiler attributes cost and
why flamegraph totals (e.g. ~90k) exceed the flat report's per-hook `work_units`
(which counts each reached effect once). Both are valid; they answer slightly
different questions. Use the tree for "where does the time go", the flat
`work_units`/heaviest-countries table for "who pays the most per tick".

## 4. The accuracy contract

Only work **reachable from a real recurring hook** is counted. Specifically:

- An event is reported as firing on a cadence **only** if a hook fires it
  textually (via `country_event`/`news_event`/`random_events` in the hook body).
- Events fired deep inside shared `scripted_effects` are counted as **ops
  (work)** but **not** attributed as fires, because those fires are usually
  gated by in-effect conditions like `if = { limit = { original_tag = HOL } }`
  that can't be evaluated statically. Attributing Holland's events to every
  country that calls the shared effect would be the classic false positive; the
  tool refuses to do it.
- `country_event = { id = X days = N }` is a one-shot **delay**, not recurrence.
  It only counts as recurring if the event reschedules **itself** in its
  `immediate` block (an automatic loop). A self-fire in an `option` is
  player-driven and is labelled `player`, not bucketed onto a cadence.
- Decision timers are read only from the real fields `days_mission_timeout` /
  `days_remove` / `days_re_enable` as **direct children** of the decision — a
  `days = N` nested inside `set_country_flag = { ... }` is never mistaken for a
  decision timer. Timer values that are variables (e.g. `ROOT.battery_park_time`)
  are bucketed `variable`, not guessed at.

## 5. Common "that looks wrong" questions

**"Every country's daily column is the same (~3934)."** Correct, not a bug. Only
8 of ~150 countries have their own `on_daily_<TAG>`; everyone else's daily cost
is purely the shared global daily hooks, so it's identical for them. The 8 that
differ show up above the floor (ITA, CZE add the most).

**"A hook shows 0 ops but I know it does something."** Older versions counted
only named `scripted_effect` calls, so a hook that just fires events or does
inline work read as 0. The current `ops` metric counts inline statements + event
fires too, so those hooks now register (e.g. `on_daily_GER` fires 2 events → ~25
ops, not 0).

**"Does event X really fire daily?"** "Flagged on a cadence" means *wired into
that tick*, still subject to its own `if`/`limit`. It means "can fire on this
beat", not "fires every time". Open the `def file:line` and read the guard.

## 6. The two report halves

- **A — on_actions**: the recurring hooks, the `scripted_effects` they invoke
  (transitively, as ops), and the events they fire (direct vs weighted
  `random_events` pools).
- **B — timers**: timed decisions bucketed by real timer field, and
  self-rescheduling event loops (`immediate` = automatic tick, `option` =
  player-driven).

## 7. Flags

```
python tools/run.py tick_audit                     # summary + heaviest countries
  --cadence daily|weekly|monthly                   # restrict to one beat
  --top N                                           # size of heaviest-country table
  --list hooks|events|decisions|loops|all          # itemize, each with file:line
  --tag TAG                                         # filter --list to a country (+globals)
  --limit N                                         # cap per --list section (0 = unlimited)
  --json PATH                                       # full report as JSON
  --flamegraph PATH                                 # interactive HTML call tree
  --tree PATH                                       # raw call tree as JSON
  --no-color
```
