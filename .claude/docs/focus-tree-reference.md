# Focus Tree Reference

On-demand reference for focus tree structure, property order, and examples. For best practices, see CLAUDE.md.

## File Naming

| Prefix   | Usage                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `00_`    | System requirements only (e.g., titlebar)    |
| `01-04_` | Shared/joint trees (EU, African Union, etc.) |
| `05_`    | Country-specific trees                       |

Prefix number forces load order: shared trees load before country-specific ones.

## Focus Tree Container

```
focus_tree = {
	id = greece_focus

	country = {
		factor = 0
		modifier = {
			tag = GRE
			add = 100
		}
	}

	shared_focus = USoE001
	shared_focus = POTEF001

	continuous_focus_position = { x = 2350 y = 1200 }
}
```

## Required Property Order

```
1.  id                          (always first)
2.  icon                        (always second)
3.  x, y coordinates
4.  relative_position_id
5.  cost
6.  allow_branch
7.  prerequisite / mutually_exclusive
8.  search_filters
9.  available / bypass / cancel
10. completion_reward / select_effect / bypass_effect
11. ai_will_do                  (ALWAYS LAST)
```

## Shared and Joint Focuses

A **shared focus** lives in one tree file and appears in several countries' trees, each pulling it in via `shared_focus = X` inside their `focus_tree`. A **joint focus** (`joint_focus = { ... }`) is a shared focus that additionally **shares completion**: when one joint country completes it, it is marked complete for every country in its joint set.

`joint_trigger` defines the **joint set** — it is evaluated per country and determines who shares completion and receives the rewards. It is **not** a selection gate; who can actually pick the focus is still governed by `available` / `visible` / `prerequisite` / `allow_branch`, exactly as in a normal focus.

| Reward block                         | Fires on                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `completion_reward`                  | every joint country                               |
| `completion_reward_joint_originator` | only the country that directly completed it       |
| `completion_reward_joint_member`     | every joint country **other than** the completer  |

### Conventions

- **All-members focus** — omit `joint_trigger` and gate `available` with the membership trigger (e.g. `benelux_cooperation_trigger`). When omitted, the default joint set is every country that has the tree, so `joint_trigger = { is_benelux_country = yes }` is redundant. `06_Commonwealth_Shared.txt` ships 38 joint focuses this way: no `joint_trigger`, `available = { is_commonwealth_member = yes }`, rewards shared across all members.
- **Country-specific focus** — gate `available` to that country **and** restrict the joint set with `joint_trigger = { original_tag = TAG }` (or an `OR` of tags). Do **not** rely on `available` alone here: the default joint set is structural (all tree-holders), so without a `joint_trigger` the other members can still receive shared completion and rewards when that country completes the focus. Keep the `joint_trigger` until this is verified in-game.

Joint focuses pick a `text_icon` titlebar style matching the joint set (`JOINT_BEL_LUX_HOL_focus_style`, `JOINT_HOL_focus_style`, etc.), defined in `common/national_focus/00_titlebar_styles.txt`.

## Example: Basic Focus

```
focus = {
	id = SER_free_market_capitalism
	icon = blr_market_economy

	x = 5
	y = 3
	relative_position_id = SER_free_elections

	cost = 5

	# allow_branch = { }
	prerequisite = { focus = SER_western_approach }
	# mutually_exclusive = { }
	search_filters = { FOCUS_FILTER_POLITICAL }

	available = {
		western_liberals_are_in_power = yes
	}
	# bypass = { }
	# cancel = { }

	completion_reward = {
		log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Focus SER_free_market_capitalism"
		add_ideas = SER_free_market_idea
	}
	# bypass_effect = { }

	ai_will_do = {
		base = 1
	}
}
```

## Example: Bankruptcy Guard in `ai_will_do`

High-cost focuses (cost >= 8, or cost >= 5 for military/economy/research) must prevent the AI from queueing them during financial collapse. Do this in `ai_will_do`, not `available`, so the player is never blocked:

```
focus = {
	id = ISR_milk_and_honey
	# ...
	cost = 10
	# ...
	ai_will_do = {
		base = 3
		modifier = {
			factor = 0
			has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse
		}
	}
}
```

## Example: `available` Matching `bypass` Pattern

Never use `available = { always = no }` on a focus that also has a `bypass`. Set `available` to match or approximate the bypass condition:

```
focus = {
	id = ISR_operation_defensive_shield

	available = {
		has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
	}

	bypass = {
		has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
	}
	# ...
}
```

## Example: Cross-Country Event Tooltips

When a focus fires an event to another country, always show the accept outcome. Include the reject outcome only when rejection triggers real effects (opinion penalty, retaliation, tariff, follow-up chain). Omit reject when it just means "nothing happens" — the accept tooltip already implies the alternative.

Both branches have real outcomes (include both):

```
completion_reward = {
	log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: focus ISR_passover_massacre executed"
	PAL = { country_event = { id = israel.68 days = 1 } }
	custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_REJECT
	effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = oper_def_shiel_tt }
	custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT
	effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = oper_city_wall_tt }
}
```

Accept-only (reject is a no-op, omit the reject block):

```
completion_reward = {
	log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: focus TAG_propose_trade_deal executed"
	OTHER = { country_event = { id = namespace.N days = 1 } }
	custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT
	effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = TAG_trade_deal_effects_tt }
}
```

## Example: `country_exists` Guard + Wargoal

Always check `country_exists` before targeting another country with wargoals:

```
available = {
	country_exists = USA
	NOT = { has_war_with = USA }
	# ideology checks...
}

completion_reward = {
	log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: focus ISR_down_with_imperialism executed"
	set_temp_variable = { wargoal_on = USA }
	set_temp_variable = { wargoal_type = 1 }
	add_threat_from_wargoal_effect = yes
	create_wargoal = {
		type = topple_government
		target = USA
		expire = 365
	}
}
```

## Building Effects (Scripted)

All buildings in effects need monetary cost — use scripted effects from `common/scripted_effects/00_scripted_effects.txt`, not raw `add_building_construction`.

### State Scope (predefined state)

```
117 = {
	one_state_industrial_complex = yes
}
```

### Random Scope (any owned state)

```
one_random_industrial_complex = yes
two_random_industrial_complex = yes
```

### Available Building Effects

| Composite Plant                     | $7.50  |

Cost includes a building slot ($1.00). To give a building without a slot, subtract $1.00.
