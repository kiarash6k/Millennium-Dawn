# Changelog Guide

How to write changelog entries for Millennium Dawn. All contributors and agents must follow these standards.

## Purpose

Changelog.txt records user-visible changes between releases. Entries explain what changed and why, so players understand the impact without reading code or diffs.

## Who Adds Entries

- **Every PR** with user-visible changes must include a Changelog.txt entry.
- The author of the change adds the entry during the PR lifecycle.
- If a change is made and no entry exists, add one before the PR is merged.

## Version Sections

Each version section begins with `vX.Y.Z` on its own line. Only add entries under the **top-most version** not yet tagged/released.

## Category Headings

Use the existing category structure. Common categories:

`Achievements:` `AI:` `Balance:` `Bugfix:` `Content:` `Database:` `Factions:` `Game Rules:` `Graphics:` `Localization:` `Map:` `Performance:` `Quality of Life:` `Sound:` `Technology:` `User Interface:`

If a change doesn't fit an existing category, use the closest match. Do not invent new categories without discussing with the project lead.

## Entry Format

```
 Category:
  - [TAG] Past-tense verb. Specific object name. (Issue #N)
```

Rules:

- **1 space** before the category name.
- **2 spaces + `- `** before each entry.
- **`[TAG]` prefix** for country-specific changes; no prefix for global changes.
- **Past tense** — describe what changed, not what will change.
- **Specific** — name the exact focus ID, event ID, decision ID, or mechanic.
- **No em dashes** — use a period to end the sentence.
- **Issue reference** — include `(Issue #N)` when the change resolves or relates to a GitHub issue.

## Examples

```
 Bugfix:
  - [ENG] Fixed typo ENG_elisabeth_ruling_monarch → ENG_elizabeth_ruling_monarch in country history, which blocked completion of the Queen's Family focus tree branch (Issue #894)
  - Converted 24 hidden events (AFG, ALG, BDI, CHI, CTR, Iran, JAP, KOR, KUR, LAR, LBR, SYR, SUD, TAL, USA, BOS) from option-based to immediate-only pattern, and removed dead localisation keys for converted events (Issue #1389)

 AI:
  - Added employment-based staffing triggers to prevent AI from taking construction focuses when it cannot staff the resulting building

 Content:
  - [HKG] Major Hong Kong content expansion: ~142-focus tree across 12 branches
```

## What Makes a Good Entry

1. **Lead with the change** — what was added, fixed, or removed?
2. **Name the specific object** — focus ID, event ID, decision ID, or mechanic.
3. **Include the impact** — what does the player notice?
4. **Use consistent casing** — match surrounding entries.

## What NOT to Write

- **No padding filler** — "Fixed an issue where the AI would not behave correctly" is not specific enough. Write "Fixed AI sending volunteers to countries it cannot reach."
- **No internal terminology** — players don't know "immediate block" or "trigger scope".
- **No em dashes** — they read as soft connectors and don't fit the changelog style.
- **No future tense** — "Will add" is wrong, "Added" is correct.
- **No duplicates** — if an entry already covers a change, don't add another for it.

## Quality Checklist

Before adding an entry, verify:

- [ ] Under the correct version section?
- [ ] Correct category?
- [ ] [TAG] prefix correct (or omitted for global changes)?
- [ ] Past tense?
- [ ] Names the specific focus/event/decision ID?
- [ ] Describes the user-visible impact?
- [ ] References the Issue # if applicable?
- [ ] No em dashes?
- [ ] Not a duplicate of an existing entry?
