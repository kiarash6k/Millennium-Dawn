**NOTE**: Non-English localisation files are **not** currently mirrored against English — full translation is deferred to a later translation project. Do **not** modify them, and do **not** flag non-English `.yml` files in reviews, audits, or branch checks for missing, stale, or diverging keys relative to English. They are expected to be out of sync; any absent key degrades gracefully to the English string or an empty value. Only English keys (and the script objects that reference them) are in scope for review.

Millennium Dawn is a Hearts of Iron IV mod (2000-present). Key directories: `common/` (game data), `events/`, `localisation/` (English `.yml`, UTF-8 BOM), `history/`, `interface/`, `gfx/`, `tools/` (Python dev scripts).

**IMPORTANT**: The `resources/` directory is for reference material only. Do NOT modify files under `resources/` unless explicitly asked by the user.

## Validation & Tools

Validation runs on GitHub CI at PR time — don't run proactively. Standardization tools: `tools/standardization/` (see its README). Diff summary: `python3 tools/analysis/review_branch.py [base-branch]`.

**Never run `pre-commit run --all-files`.** Pre-commit's auto-fixers (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, mixed-line-ending, fix-byte-order-marker) rewrite every matching file in the repo and leave hundreds of unrelated whitespace-only modifications in the worktree. Always scope runs to actually-modified files: `pre-commit run --files <path1> <path2>`, or rely on the normal `git commit` flow which only feeds staged files to the hooks. The branch you are on may already carry whitespace noise from a prior `--all-files` run — if it does, revert anything outside the scope of the task before committing.

### Pre-commit vs CI divergence

Pre-commit and CI do not run the same hook set. Things that pass locally can still fail CI, and vice versa:

- Most content validators run **CI-only**: the `validate-core` / `validate-targeted` matrices in `.github/workflows/coding-pipeline.yml` are the gate. Their old `stages: [manual]` pre-commit hooks were removed (almost nobody ran them). On `git commit` only the fast subset runs — the `md-validate-content` dispatcher (`tools/precommit_validate.py`, which fans the commit-stage validators out in parallel), plus `check_common_mistakes.py` and `validate_defines.py`. To run a CI-only validator locally: `python3 tools/validation/validate_<topic>.py --staged --no-color` (drop `--staged` for a full-repo scan).
- `validate_ai_equipment.py` runs without `--strict` locally (coverage gaps would block all commits) but **with** `--strict` on CI. Equipment-coverage gaps that are tolerated locally will fail PR validation.
- `check_braces.py`, `fix_loc_yaml.py`, `validate_localization_encoding.py`, `validate_mod_encoding.py` are **pre-commit-only** — never run on CI. Web-UI edits or contributors with hooks disabled can land broken braces or BOM regressions.
- `validate_defines.py` runs on pre-commit against the live install and on CI against the committed `tools/validation/vanilla_defines.txt` manifest. Regenerate the manifest with `gen_vanilla_defines_manifest.py` after a HOI4 version bump (same for `vanilla_sprites.txt` via `gen_vanilla_sprites_manifest.py`).
- `validate_ideas.py` is wired into both pre-commit (`--staged --strict`) and CI (`strict: false`, informational) until the ~30 pre-existing undefined-idea references on main are triaged. Once cleared, flip the CI entry to strict.
- `validate_unused_textures.py` is wired into pre-commit as `stages: [manual]` and into CI as informational (`strict: false`). The repo currently carries ~22k unreferenced textures — informational mode keeps the audit visible without blocking PRs.
- `validate_set_variables.py` runs **CI-only** (informational). Its false-positive volume at repo scale makes it too noisy for a commit gate, so it has no pre-commit hook; run it directly (`python3 tools/validation/validate_set_variables.py`) against a specific variable when needed.

### Tooling deprecation watch

- `pre-commit/mirrors-prettier` is archived upstream. Maintained fork: `rbubley/mirrors-prettier`. Migrate next time the prettier pin needs touching.

## Formatting

- Tabs for indentation; `{` on same line, `}` on own line at outer indent; 1 blank line between elements
- Simple checks on one line: `available = { has_country_flag = some_flag }`
- Comments are small, targeted, and load-bearing: add one only when the _why_ is non-obvious and removing it would lose real information, and keep it to a single line. Cut anything that restates the code, narrates a change, points at callers, or justifies a mechanic in flavour prose (see `.claude/rules/general-rules.md`; Python tooling: `tools/COMMENT_STYLE.md`)
- Remove unused/commented-out code
- `* 0.01` not `/ 100`; `if/else` not two `if` with complementary conditions
- Prefix country-specific variables with tag (e.g., `ISR_operation_success`)
- **snake_case** for all identifiers

## Performance

- Always `is_triggered_only = yes`; use `on_daily_TAG` not global triggers
- Replace `every_country`/`random_country` with array triggers
- Use dynamic modifiers sparingly; avoid `force_update_dynamic_modifier`

## Focus Trees

- ID: `TAG_focus_name`; use `relative_position_id`
- Always: logging, `ai_will_do = { base = N }`, `search_filters` (two-layer pattern, see `.claude/docs/search-filters.md`)
- Omit defaults: `cancel_if_invalid = yes`, `continue_if_invalid = no`, `available_if_capitulated = no`
- No empty `mutually_exclusive`/`available` blocks; limit permanent effects to 5
- Never `available = { always = no }` with a `bypass` — use matching condition
- High-cost focuses (cost >= 8, or >= 5 for mil/econ/research): add a bankruptcy guard inside `ai_will_do`:
  ```
  modifier = {
      factor = 0
      has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse
  }
  ```
- Ref: `.claude/docs/focus-tree-reference.md`

## Decisions

- Logging in `complete_effect`: `log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision DECISION_ID"`
- `ai_will_do = { base = N }` — `base` not `factor` at root
- Ref: `.claude/docs/decision-reference.md`

## Events

- Always `is_triggered_only = yes`; log only if option has effects; `major = yes` for news only
- Date-based events: use `common/scripted_effects/00_yearly_effects.txt` with owner-guard pattern
- Cross-country events: add `TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` tooltip; add `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` only if rejection has consequences (see `.claude/rules/general-rules.md`)
- `add_building_construction` for `naval_base` requires `province = XXXXX`
- New subideology parties: register in `common/scripted_localisation/00_subideology_scripted_localisation.txt`
- Ref: `.claude/docs/event-reference.md`

## Ideas

- Always include `picture = sprite_name` — ideas without a picture show a blank icon
- Include `allowed_civil_war = { always = yes }` for civil war tags
- Use `original_tag` not `tag` in `allowed` blocks
- `country`/`hidden_ideas` categories: remove `allowed = { always = no }` (default) and `allowed = { tag = TAG }`; other categories: `allowed` is load-bearing
- Remove `cancel = { always = no }` and empty `on_add = { log = "" }`
- Ref: `.claude/docs/idea-reference.md`

## MIOs

- ID: `TAG_organization_name`; always `allowed = { original_tag = TAG }`
- `task_capacity` proportional to nation size (10-25)
- Trait grid `y = 0..9`; add `initial_trait` for defining bonus
- Ref: `.claude/docs/mio-reference.md`

## Intelligence Agency Upgrades

New upgrades require wiring across five files: definition, on_actions registry (four arrays + bump `resize_array size =`), loc triple (`id`/`_name`/`_gfx`), scripted_gui prereqs, sprite in `interface/*.gfx`. See `common/intelligence_agency_upgrades/README.md`.

## AI Strategies & Equipment

Unit production has three layers: threat gate (`ai_is_threatened` live scripted trigger), role ratios, templates. See `.claude/docs/ai-strategy-reference.md`.

- `role_ratio id` must match `role` in `common/ai_templates/` (validated by pre-commit hook)
- Unit names are case-sensitive (validated by pre-commit hook)
- Subjects are excluded from `ai_default_no_build_units` (`is_subject = no`) and get a defensive baseline via `ai_subject_defensive_build`
- `give_AI_templates` uses `division_template` with `has_template` guards

Equipment variants (`common/ai_equipment/`): see `.claude/docs/ai-equipment-reference.md`. Key rules:

- Every role template needs `category`, `roles`, top-level `priority`; every design needs `target_variant` with `type`, `match_value`, `modules`
- Nations blocked from generic files must have all roles covered in custom/shared files (validated by pre-commit hook)
- CV planes: `ai_type` must be one of `cv_fighter`/`cv_interceptor`/`cv_cas`/`cv_naval_bomber`/`cv_suicide`
- `equipment_variant_production_factor` penalties cascade to subtypes — keep base penalties <= -25%

## Shell Session

- **Never reset the working directory.** Do not `cd` to a different repo, drive, or temp path "just to run one command." The working directory is fixed for the session; relative paths and follow-up edits assume it. Use absolute paths or per-command flags (e.g., `git -C <dir>`, `grep <path>`, `pre-commit run --files <path>`) instead. Even commands that appear to recover (`cd <repo-root> && ...`) have already broken the invariant for any tool that snapshots cwd before the command runs.

## Git Commits

- Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By` or sign commits — the project does not use commit signing

## Output Style

Keep all output token-efficient: conversation replies, agent hand-back reports, PR/issue/Changelog text, and commit messages alike.

- Lead with the conclusion (the answer, what changed, what was found). Cut preamble and restating the request.
- Report facts, not process. Skip "I read X, then I...", tool-by-tool narration, and self-congratulation.
- No padding confirmations ("As requested, I have successfully..."). State the result plainly.
- Prefer terse bullets and `file:line` references over prose paragraphs. Drop empty sections rather than writing "N/A".
- Be complete, not verbose: never drop a real finding, caveat, path, or identifier to save space. Trim words, not information.
